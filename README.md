# Platypus

Platypus is intended to be a framework for evolutionary computing in Python,
with a focus on multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).  Platypus is
a rewrite and extension of the [MOEA Framework](http://moeaframework.org) (Java)
to Python.  Furthermore, Platypus is intended to be compatible with other Python
modeling and analysis tools, such as OpenMDAO.
